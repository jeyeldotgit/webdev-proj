# Git Rules – SproutLMS

This document defines the Git workflow, conventions, and rules. Its goal is to keep history clean, readable, and safe as the project scales.

---

## 1. Branching Strategy

### Primary Branches

-   **`main`**

    -   Always deployable
    -   Contains only stable, reviewed code
    -   No direct commits allowed

-   **`dev`**

    -   Integration branch for active development
    -   All feature branches merge here first

---

### Supporting Branches

-   **Feature branches**

    -   Naming: `feature/<short-description>`
    -   Examples:

        -   `feature/auth-form`
        -   `feature/dashboard-stats`
        -   `feature/portfolio-builder`

-   **Fix branches**

    -   Naming: `fix/<short-description>`
    -   Example: `fix/zod-validation-error`

-   **Refactor branches**

    -   Naming: `refactor/<scope>`
    -   Example: `refactor/builder-components`

---

## 2. Commit Message Convention

Follow a **clear, imperative style**.

### Format

```
<type>: <short summary>
```

### Allowed Types

-   `feat` – New feature
-   `fix` – Bug fix
-   `refactor` – Code refactor (no behavior change)
-   `chore` – Tooling, config, cleanup
-   `docs` – Documentation only
-   `style` – Formatting, linting (no logic changes)

### Examples

-   `feat: add schema-driven portfolio builder`
-   `fix: prevent save when portfolio schema is invalid`
-   `refactor: split builder into section components`
-   `docs: add project implementation documentation`

---

## 3. Commit Rules

-   One logical change per commit
-   Commits should compile and pass basic checks
-   Avoid committing commented-out code
-   Do not commit temporary logs unless intentional

Bad:

```
feat: update builder
```

Good:

```
feat: add experience section to portfolio builder
```

---

## 4. Pull Request Rules

-   All changes go through a Pull Request
-   PRs must:

    -   Target `dev`
    -   Have a clear title and description
    -   Reference the feature or fix being implemented

### PR Description Template

-   **What was added/changed**
-   **Why it was added**
-   **Screenshots (if UI-related)**
-   **Notes / Follow-ups**

---

## 5. File & Code Hygiene

-   No secrets or API keys in commits
-   `.env` files must be gitignored
-   Mock data (`mockdata.json`) is allowed
-   Generated files should not be committed

---

## 6. Refactor & Cleanup Policy

-   Refactors must not introduce behavior changes unless explicitly stated
-   Large refactors should be isolated in their own branch
-   Prefer multiple small commits over one massive commit

---

## 7. Documentation Rules

-   Major features must update:

    -   `README.md` (if user-facing)
    -   `gitrules.md` (if workflow changes)
    -   Architecture docs (if structure changes)

Documentation-only changes use:

```
docs: <description>
```

---

## 8. Philosophy

-   Git history should tell a story
-   Commits are documentation
-   Clean history > fast history

> "If it’s hard to explain in a commit message, it’s probably doing too much."
